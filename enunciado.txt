A task is assigned to the teams, where both will have to operate in the financial market using fictitious credit of R$ 1,000,000.00 to purchase stocks in the stock exchange, based on REAL data. The team that achieves the highest profitability/return on investment wins the task. In this sense, consider that both teams have chosen the same financial asset for investment and have adopted a statistical methodology for decision making. The 10-day historical series of this asset is shown in the figure next to it. Therefore, as an initial methodology, consider a bilateral confidence interval of 95%, as well as for the buying and selling of shares, the extreme values of this interval.

Develop a Python program that determines:

A) the ideal values for buying and selling stocks, which are the extreme values ​​of this confidence interval;

B) the approximate value of the expected profit.

Observations: As a result of running the code, the buying and selling values ​​should appear via terminal, as well as the quantity of shares purchased (nearest integer), and the profit obtained.

I turned the 10-day historical series in a json.
